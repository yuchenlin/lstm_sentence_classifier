Here is a film that begins with merciless comic savagery and descends into merely merciless savagery . But wow , what an opening .
-1

Not so much a bad movie as a dispiritingly unnecessary one ( especially by a once-great director) , Youth Without Youth ultimately boils down to a long , autumn stroll around the block to a place everyone winds up at some time or another .
-1

It 's a very minor Catcher in the Rye , featuring clever but overcooked dialogue , two-dimensional supporting roles , and a disarming generosity toward its characters .
-1

Yes , this is another movie where suspense is shuttled aside for actors yelling at the top of their lungs and many meaningless things going much more than ' bump ' in the Ukrainian night .

My favorite part of The Lorax was the Despicable Me 2 trailer . Honestly .
-1

The filmmakers seem to think the audience they covet consists entirely of dumb , shallow kids who'll buy anything they're told is cool .

It 's not Heather Courtney 's fault that PBS dishes out comfort food for the liberal elite .
-1

... while our brains quickly comprehend Sternfeld 's point , our hearts never quite get the message .

Director Peter Webber clearly wants Hannibal Rising to be a class production . Unfortunately , he makes the whole affair too artsy and staid for its own good , which results in a plodding pace that induces more eyelid drooping than tension .
-1

Along with makeup and sisterly advice , the regular teenager Sophie provides the trained killer Hanna with a glimpse of what she 's missed .
-1

Tim Allen 's third film with director John Pasquin may not be as bad as Jungle 2 Jungle , but it does come near making The Santa Clause seem like a work of Buñuel .
-1

It would only be respectful to hang up Big Momma 's oversized girdle once and for all .
-1

None of the seven shorts here is worth a single , well-made feature .
-1

The picture has a hapless , meandering quality that 's tolerable at first but ultimately becomes maddening , as if it were a cartoon narrative recounted by a distracted 4-year-old .
-1

Unfortunately , the film is destined for a very limited audience as presently constructed ; it plays as a Cliff 's Notes visual introduction to the artist 's letters to his brother .
-1

Adaptation of Tolstoy novel opulent but sunk by lack of emotional involvement
-1

Rowan Atkinson gives an astonishingly quiet performance in this not-quite-black-enough comedy .
-1

Somewhat clunky
-1

Nothing anyone does in this movie makes any sense .
-1

Gosh , this is a good-natured movie .
-1

The editing in the first scenes destroys any possible audience involvement in the mystery by tipping its hand too soon .
-1

More a garage sale of stories by writer-director Richard Curtis , Love Actually gives its underused British cast something to do with no Harry Potter film this year .
-1

Overwrought .
-1

Little other than the love story subplot to energize the proceedings , many viewers will find that , for all its grace , The Dancer Upstairs moves too slowly .
-1

Sorely lacking in suspense , humor or originality , Agent Cody Banks aspires to the lowest rung of the peanut gallery .
-1

The anomic gloom that envelops Frownland , a miserabilist , micro-budgeted 16mm freak show , fatally impedes its seeming aspirations to the mercurial grit of Cassavetes .
-1

Whomever owns it they can keep it cause we've all got better things to do at night than to see a virtually unconscious film that makes Johnny Dangerously look like Angels with Dirty Faces .
-1

MacDowell and Brody give emotionally galvanizing performances , but too often Flowers arranges itself on a bier that goes flat .
-1

Only big fans of Cera and Black need catch this film , and even then , it 's far from a must-see .
-1

Christmas is definitely cancelled in this over-acted , over-here movie . Presumably the tinsel was CGI'd in to complement the season of its release .
-1

Despite a ton of stars , a flock of directors , and more Bonds than you can shake a martini at , the movie is close to a complete disaster .
-1

It should feel like Star Wars , yet it fails to feel like a movie at all . Conran has done his work almost too well . It 's as if you're sitting in front of an outsize comic book with a speed reader as page-turner .
-1

Benjamin Walker plays Lincoln straight-faced , and it 's a funny concept . But the vampires lack bite .
-1

Should auld acquaintance be forgot ? I don't know , but " New Year 's Eve " sure should be .
-1

A fairly routine action picture with an advanced case of grandeuritis .
-1

Hood a real Howler .
-1

Predictability is the fatal flaw of any American sequel , and while this one comes closest in tone to the original film , that 's a decidedly double-edged sword .
-1

What this film lacked was a real sense of the bizarre ... .
-1

A dragon with audible thoughts and no voice is even less interesting than one who can talk .
-1

Carrie and Company Deliver the Same Old Song and Dance
-1

Visually , it adores the women it introduces . Emotionally and intellectually , it mocks them .
-1

Aniston isn't the world 's greatest actress , but the main reason The Bounty Hunter stinks is the script .
-1

The connections seem less immediate and significant , and so the movie sometimes seems based on a group of separate short stories .
-1

Only Terrence Malick could get away with this .
-1

A potentially great title-role performance by Benicio Del Toro , which won him the best actor award at Cannes , is buried beneath Soderbergh 's stylistic tics and a defiant lack of dramatic tension .
-1

There is no good reason to make a trip to see My Baby 's Daddy , but at least it goes down painlessly enough and isn't a complete wash .
-1

A romance whose anodyne find-your-bliss theme is likeable but underwhelming , Lee Kirk 's The Giant Mechanical Man doesn't fully exploit its premise 's charms .
-1

The idea behind the film is such a good one that I wish a more talented filmmaker than Kevin Willmott , and one with better resources , had come up with it .
-1

Dovetails with the current Occupy message but still feels rather stale .
-1

A tedious , pandering time-waster .
-1

Wang ... needlessly pads the movie with heart-tugging gimmicks and canned melodrama that undercuts its raw impact .
-1

Ashutosh Gowariker 's new movie , an adaptation of a Gujarati novel by Madhu Rye , is epic in length only .
-1

This space-set , " found footage " horror flick never lifts off .
-1

Even the heaving bosom looks clunky .
-1

Watching one action cliche after another , the audience 's natural reaction to the film 's conclusion has to be , ' Yeah , right !'
-1

I'm frankly amazed the foolish , cheap-looking thing didn't go straight to the Sci-Fi Channel .
-1

What 's most disappointing about the 2009 version is that it strips all the moral ambiguity from the 1972 original of the same name .
-1

With leads who strain to manage one facial expression between them , and a cinematographer shooting everything through the same steel-blue filter , Underworld : Evolution is a monotonous barrage of computer-generated fur and fangs .
-1

Yu might as well look at the background ; you are not missing much in the foreground .
-1

' Just Friends ' is just average .
-1

Cloaking vigilante justice ( not to mention casual racism and homophobia ) in religion eventually turns Boondock Saints from merely a bad movie to a distasteful one .
-1

It knows what it 's looking for and , once it finds it , it serves it up to its own chosen audience of Blue Staters . It 's the flip side of its own subjects . It 's preaching to the unconverted .
-1

The dance routines aren't all that bad , but this turkey is too late for thanksgiving . Give it a miss .
-1

I hesitate to be this brutal , but there is really no way around it . January Jones was just terrible . She barely moves her face , she seemingly has no emotion , even during a life or death moment , and her scenes with Neeson were just ... creepy .
-1

Shaving the corns off of your toes is time better spent .
-1

Once in awhile , a movie sets me searching for its origins . That 's what ' The Smurfs ' did . I guessed this movie wasn't quite what their creator had in mind - and I was right .
-1

The coarseness wouldn't be so bad if at least the steady stream of obscenities were funny . But there is , after all , an art to talking dirty .
-1

You might chuckle a couple of times , but it is literally a couple , and that 's nowhere near enough humour , especially for kids .
-1

" Ultrasonic " recalls better indie films like " Pi " and " Primer ," but there 's just not enough story to stretch over 90 minutes , resulting in several scenes that feel like filler , propelled by Rao 's good but occasionally too-intrusive electronica score .
-1

... lost in the twilight between Gothic social drama and lurid exploitation .
-1

The rare jolt of adrenaline is meager compensation for the dopey pastiche of every successful supernatural thriller of the last decade .
-1

The pacing isn't quite as screwy as the premise and it winds up with the occasional lag while it chases too much of any particular subplot
-1

Fails to rise above medium-to-low expectations , but it 's not a huge mistake
-1

A horrid assault on the senses .
-1

Simultaneously nakedly formulaic and oddly clumsy .
-1

It brings to the big screen that corner of the talent pool where ' who 's your agent ?' means ' where will you be patrolling Sunset in your ' actor for hire ' sandwich-board ?'
-1

For all its sound and fury , this is a decidedly dull affair .
-1

Plagued by phony poetic moments and self-conscious quirkiness ( Maria de Medeiros appears as a braid-wearing hair stylist obsessed with Milli Vanilli ... )
-1

You won't stop expecting Tom Hanks to jump in and dance out ' Chopsticks ' on the big flat piano on the floor ...
-1

Wearyingly violent and drearily shot .
-1

The story is often mesmerizing , even when the pace is slow and little action appears to occur . Yet after so much terrific buildup , the denouement is a letdown .
-1

View From the Top is one of those misguided movies that mistakes wackiness for depth .
-1

Unfortunately , nothing else in Is Anybody There ? quite equals the main performances . There are nice moments throughout , but it meanders a bit . We learn a little about the other residents , but not enough to invest emotionally .
-1

The cinematic visualisation of the upper class of Pinem - is painted with a surrealist brush that Salvador Dali might have dropped ( but) .. falls short of expectations , registering a low emotional score despite all that is at stake
-1

Contempt for the audience doesn't begin to describe it .
-1

Unlike When Harry Met Sally , director Reiner 's greatest romantic-comedy achievement , Alex & Emma never reaches the point where you root for the couple to get together .
-1

If you thought things could only get better following Killers and The Ugly Truth , you're in for a nasty surprise .
-1

Epic trilogy 's final installment feels like a trailer for itself -- and more than a little bit wrong .
-1

Drugs ? Alcohol ? A cruel hypnotist ? What can explain why studio executives green-lit this bizarre misfire ?
-1

More often , Mekas 's focus on " names " comes off as a cloistered insensitivity to the wider world .
-1

The 1996 original is classier , deeper , more poignant . A Ginger Rogers to this Beyoncé .
-1

It 's not the years nor the mileage that has made this film a disappointment . It 's the fact that by stepping into the digital era Indiana Jones has lost his magic .
-1

Eat Pray Love is mostly a slog ; never giving us a compelling reason why its heroine does what she does , or how she became quite so tiresomely self- absorbed .
-1

Though Westfeldt has a winning way with a punch line and a perky screen presence that is very much in the Diane Keaton/Jenna Elfman mode , the picture ultimately feels like yesterday 's brisket .
-1

Rather infuriatingly , he completely skips over the most controversial era in Guevara 's life -- when he was in power .
-1

A ghastly sort of Nora Ephron-ish good taste pervades this romcom-tearjerker .
-1

The only thing to care about is what lotion Beckinsale uses to make her skin hold up so well in sub-zero temps .
-1

The audience is subject to a constant tone of foreboding danger , but The Box is more tease than delivery .
-1

After a well-constructed first act , the story becomes a little tiresome and repetitive and the characters , who are will defined to begin with , stray ever closer to the edge of overwrought one-dimensionality .
-1

More well-aimed wit was needed , less grapeshot wackiness .
-1

Filmmaker Jaume Balaugueró should have been content with the first [ REC] , a claustrophobic tour de force . Now the franchise is out on the sidewalk , selling itself to the tired , the jaded , the kerb-crawling .
-1

Playing God , faith and doubt are the central themes of Rowan Woods ' Winged Creatures , an engaging but often frustrating film in which beginnings and endings are intertwined
-1

... ultimately comes off as nothing less than a total disaster .
-1

Dupree feels like the most opportunistic of Hollywood ' packages ' -- a trio of appealing stars with proven track records in this sort of fare paired with a script that 's been cobbled together out of odds and ends of other , better movies .
-1

It takes some sort of talent to make a film as completely strident , overbearing , heavy-handed and downright off-putting as The Life of David Gale , although it 's not exactly clear what type of talent it requires .
-1

The most remarkable special effect is Ben Kingsley 's hair , a thick thatch so white it almost glows in the dark and a little white soul patch under his lip . Now that 's scary .
-1

Sluggishly paced , of minor consequence , and increasingly derivative in form and content .
-1

Brought to you by Participant Media , makers of Food , Inc . and The Cove . Next time , guys , give a hoot and don't pollute the multiplex . Save the children . [ Blu-ray ]

Simple .

Conversations With God is not a movie ; it 's a brand extension .
-1

A poor man 's version of a Judd Apatow-style raunchy romantic comedy .
-1

A joyless series of shooting-up scenes .
-1

As wrongheaded as Coppola 's Dracula ( in different ways) , Frankenstein is all bluff , bombast and bargain-basement borrowings from Ken Russell 's Gothic .
-1

Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones seem to be simply punching their time cards this time around .
-1

Most concert films follow familiar formulas , and this one is no exception ... Cynics may find a motive for the film in Cohen 's recent legal problems .
-1

One wishes the end result was a better tribute to a remarkable talent taken before his time .
-1

Unlike its subject matter , there 's just nothing spectacular or unique about Rose .
-1

A one-joke movie .
-1

For a film devoted to investigating the complex repercussions of a sudden family death , The Greatest may be far too transparent in its bids for audience emotion .
-1

Romano and Caltabiano mostly watch TV and squabble about whose fault it is they're running a few minutes late .
-1

[ It ] bungles key moments that have built-in dramatic weight from the book with ordinary staging and a breakneck pace . Many of the movies , including this one , have merely summarized the books rather than actually interpreting them .
-1

It 's not the worst of the franchise , but it 's dangerously close .
-1

Entourage with cancer .
-1

A suffocating 151 minutes long , with a healthy portion of that running time devoted to a hunk of Holocausploitation of the most crass and cynical variety . And that 's the good part .
-1

I was actually rather bored by this listless and , if you'll excuse the pun , lifeless sequel , and if it is the concluding chapter in my humble opinion it is a final cut that couldn't have come soon enough .
-1

If it 's successful at the box office , look for Hollywood executives to green-light the bone-chilling tale of the Easter bunny and the macabre legend of Tickle Me Elmo .
-1

DAY NIGHT DAY NIGHT has an intriguing premise but I did feel that the filmmaker failed to deliver on her intentions .
-1

Doesn't make a lick of sense .
-1

These guys don't much about making movies , but they know how to stage a smack down .
-1

Takes its cues from ... Peter Jackson 's Lord of the Rings trilogy and HBO 's hit series Game of Thrones . If only it ever felt as grand as the former , or were as incest and decapitation laden as the latter .
-1

A game of three halves , this jogs well into at least 30 minutes of extra time , while the screenplay so oozes with earnestness you'll be wiping the inspiration off your face .
-1

Who knew controversy could be so dull ?
-1

This movie hypes the old glammers , with a story of such banality it encourages brain death .
-1

The problem is not that the director is working but that his latest film is working too hard . Way too hard â" this thing is melodrama running a marathon .
-1

... so remarkably free of laughs I might as well have been watching John Wayne Gacy 's home movies .
-1

A well-intentioned but not entirely successful blend of tragic melodrama , social-issue expose and compassionate portraiture ...
-1

Limp , lazy , unfocussed ... about as funny as flat champagne .
-1

The black-and-white visuals disturb for only so long , and while themes of indoctrination and conspiracy prove initially intriguing , the film quickly descends into fistfights and gunfire .
-1

... relies almost entirely on Dunaway 's histrionics to propel the story forward - resulting in a movie that 's good for a few unintentional laughs but little else .
-1

Even Parker Posey 's turn as a campy vampiress feels phoned in , as if she is making bank in order to stomach the deferred or minimal pay of her next ten indie pet projects .
-1

It 's too heavy . It 's too bitter . And it 's definitely got too many nuts .
-1

The hilarious sting of the TV show is gone ; only the rubber-faced shtick remains .
-1

The film naturally has its share of gruesome moments , but it 's also surprisingly dull and uninvolving .
-1

McG can't seem to decide whether he 's making a spy action flick with romance interspersed or a rom-com peppered with action .
-1

Feels canned and empty .
-1

Both the actress and the character she 's playing are stranded in a vapid film about vapid teens .
-1

This take on the Arthurian legend is flawed but watchable .
-1

The cast expertly incarnates this family haunted by loss , lovelessness and ( literal ) bad blood , but the film 's unduly protracted duration makes the Vuillards feel like Christmas guests who just will not leave .
-1

Obsessed is a particularly silly example of the [ bunny boiler ] genre with little rhyme or reason to the story and direction that is singularly lacking in subtlety .
-1

Substituting action for charm , the sequel is a visual treat but not a sufficient comedic or narrative one , taking only modest advantage of Jack Black 's game voice work .
-1

A mixed bag of absolutely hilarious moments and parts where you want to leave the theater .
-1

Crushing tediousness .
-1

There is no shortage of twists and turns , but nearly all are easily maneuvered , and those that aren't only tend to test the traditional suspense-movie suspension of disbelief .
-1

Crisply shot in gritty black and white , Suddenly 's forceful visual style just doesn't compensate for its hollow psychological core .
-1

The film is garish and frenetic but absolutely lifeless .
-1

In every other way , The Big Bounce is a dreadful exercise , with a script full of contradictions and empty gestures and a leading lady who 's such a novice it hurts to watch her .
-1

There 's so little to this film that you've almost forgotten everything about it by the time the closing credits start to roll .
-1

To be fair , Evil Aliens is going for a very specific audience , and viewers who ordinarily enjoy this sort of thing will probably not be disappointed .
-1

Audiences will be dumber for having watched this movie ; some may even lose respect for the Bard .
-1

Why didn't Miramax release this star-free slasher flick directly to DVD , especially when the theatrical release seems to exploit the news of Hurricane Katrina ?
-1

Like the details of the Japanese attack in Pearl Harbor , the historical events in The Four Feathers only exist to provide the framework for the telling of a predictable and implausible romance .
-1

For a movie that rails against the notion of creative artists toiling amid corporate gloom , Robots often feels calculated and mass-produced .
-1

Dozens of inept thrillers are churned out every year , only a few are ever this simpering .
-1

Doesn't know when to step on the brakes before it turns itself in to a one-note shtick movie .
-1

How far must these vets have fallen to endure two farting scenes , a peeing-in-the-pool scene , and repeated use of the phrase , " you're my ***** ."
-1

Full of cartoonish characters and clichéd dialog , it 's long and lame .
-1

The movie , directed by sophomore Michael Bay ( Bad Boys ) is almost unwatchable .
-1

McKendry doesn't pull off either the action nor the drama to any satisfaction .
-1

Basinger has wisely bided her time and chosen her post-Oscar project carefully . It 's a pity that in this empty spectacle , she comes off lost in the bush .
-1

Just another slice of life film that gets derailed .
-1

Let 's be blunt : It 's a place to dump the kids off for 89 minutes .
-1

A teen comedy that views sex as an all-you-can-gorge buffet .
-1

Both Rossi and Charlotte Rampling , as the mother of another young patient , do fine work . But the only surprises come at the end , too late to move us the way they should .
-1

The film has some of the bleak inevitability of Jim Jarmusch 's Dead Man , but without the compelling characters and oddball twists .
-1

It 's about 40 IQ points dumber than the typical public television broadcast .
-1

Self-parody would seem too generous an assessment of Lynch 's aims and achievement .
-1

While Troche shows style and accomplishment in tackling and balancing such a complex scale , her script leaves something to be desired .
-1

Compared with Mann 's other films , Miami Vice lacks the slam-bang set pieces of Heat and the human dynamic of Collateral .
-1

The days when Woody Allen told Keaton there was nothing wrong with her character that couldn't be cured ' with Prozac and a polo mallet ' are long gone here .
-1

This seems like a ripping good idea . In practice , " Pina " turns out to have a few problems .
-1

Suffice it to say that Shakespeare 's sudden and violent ending doesn't translate well into a British crime drama .
-1

What say we let these folks take another stab at it with a better script , OK ?
-1

Freddy Got Fingered makes Dude , Where 's My Car ? look like an Oscar contender .
-1

As hard as I , Robot attempts to come off as brilliant vision of a futuristic utopia ... the end result is nothing more then a garbled mess .
-1

Disappointingly uncharacteristic of Sokurov , the humanist moments that pass between them lean toward token sentiment , and the moments that pass between Alexandra and the grandson she traveled so far to see feel inconsequential .
-1

Albert Pierrepoint single-handedly killed over 450 people in his career , dispatching most of them with an icy precision in less than 30 seconds .
-1

At no point should Lockout be taken too seriously . Don't expect big plot surprises or slick effects ( the earthbound motorcycle chase is particularly lame ) or even anything that looks like romance .
-1

With such an impressive opening , The Rite isn't a complete failure . However , I have to admit , toward the end of this movie , I was rooting for the Devil to win .
-1

Probably the worst of the Nightmare on Elm Street flicks .
-1

There is no psychological depth , no real motivation , no human values to weigh , just characters jerked here and there like puppets in an arbitrary plot .
-1

A stupid , petulant exercise in racism and misogyny .
-1

It 's filled with shocking dialogue and disturbing content , but treats it all in a strangely facile way .
-1

For all the hurting and hollering , The Last Kiss rarely pushes its emotions from scripted to authentic .
-1

Smith may have pioneered this kind of upfront sex chat , but the Apatow team refined it . ' Zack and Miri ' feels uncomfortably like a gruesome game of filth-talk oneupmanship , and it 's hard to care who comes out on top .
-1

The Great Raid has an old-fashioned feel -- that is , old-fashioned in a musty way .
-1

Written and directed by Max Mayer , this anodyne romantic comedy is as predictable as the alphabet but should hold particular appeal to women whose maternal impulses inflect their mating instincts .
-1

... has clearly been geared exclusively towards younger viewers ( indiscriminating , undemanding younger viewers at that) .
-1

It 's part travelogue in Hell , part ineffectual weepie .
-1

A bloated 86 minutes of overzealous spookiness .
-1

It all feels a bit like an uninspired take on Christopher Guest 's genuinely hilarious Waiting for Guffman .
-1

Predictably redundant and not as consistently wet-your-pants hilarious as the project 's been pitched ... its feature-length exhibition was obviously an afterthought .
-1

Lee may have a keen sense of setting and dialogue , but his characterization is off .
-1

The generically attractive young cast gamely tries to pump life into the script , to no avail .
-1

A new-fashioned but old-fangled hash .
-1

It 's hard to say whether gleaming automobiles or women 's bodies are given the more fetishlike treatment in this vanity production .
-1

Hickernell soft-pedals the material into a blandly feel-good dramedy .
-1

It 's like a Gregg Araki-circa-1995 movie , hijacked by Sofia Coppola in full-on fractured-family mode : sorta violent , but not quite right ; sorta tender , but slightly off .
-1

Doom is like some kid came over and is using your computer and won't let you play .
-1

A tedious dud that sparks once or twice with big laughs
-1

Black and White plays more like a half-finished film essay than a provocative entertainment .
-1

Listening to the others sounding like a spouse in the shower makes one wonder : How bad could Barrymore be that she had to be dubbed ?
-1

Without a plausible story , Rumor Has It has only its performances to get it by , and a very familiar performance -- from Shirley MacLaine , as Beau 's still bawdy , one-time seductress -- is the best we get .
-1

The film moves from plot point to plot point methodically , and it feels as if it is working harder to cover all bases than to provide a memorable cinematic experience .
-1

There was nothing fresh or particularly interesting in this human interest drama , but at least it was sincere and moving and unpretentious .
-1

There 's something to admire in Bachelorette 's initial flag-planting outrageousness , even if it goes too far and then sheepishly pulls back to a more conventional conclusion .
-1

Definitely one made for the smaller set .
-1

Overly long and literally unfocused documentary about the wine industry .
-1

Awfully difficult to watch outside of its 1991 womb , with its limitations cringe-inducing , reducing a powerful statement of frustration to no-budget After School Special .
-1

More confusion than clarity .
-1

Let 's put it this way : it 's a 90-minute comedy , and I laughed just once ( the guy in front of me spilled popcorn on his whiny date , if you must know) .
-1

This sequel , sans Spielberg but obedient to his spirit , simply fails to regenerate the original 's gut-grinding fears ...

Veni vidi vomit . That 's Latin for : I came , I saw , I saw ' Saw II .'

Olivia Munn is fun to look and , but you'd never guess at how talented Paul Schneider really is from the looks of this comic travesty .
-1

Bad News Bears has been robbed of its nerve and repackaged for multiplex consumption .
-1

Unfortunately , that same suspense -- Poisoned wine ! Secret pacts ! Doppelgangers ! -- is sometimes a little too stiff , making Monsieur N . play at times like a second-tier Agatha Christie mystery .
-1

As history , it seems a fairly accurate account of what happened , although it never much bothers its head about why . As film art , it is nothing less than a $25-million irrelevancy .
-1

Breaking Dawn - Part 1 as a whole feels stretched-out , as if the filmmakers realized belatedly that there wasn't enough material in the book to sustain two movies . ( There isn't).

Hugely ambitious but often failing to live up to those ambitions .

[ It ] would be a great horror movie , if it were a horror movie .

Hastily conceived ... Enough is a manufactured and staid thriller that only trivializes the social illness of domestic violence

In " Capitalism : A Love Story ," Michael Moore casts a fiery eye at the U.S. financial system - a rich and appalling subject at the moment - and comes , alas , to the usual loopy conclusion

Comparisons to Crash are fair only up to a point , given how Babel is prone to sacrificing character at the altar of the almighty shock tactic , but the film more accurately brings to mind the schematic , globe-trotting Syriana .

Delaporte , a documentarist making her feature debut , breathes life into the scenes where the reluctant antiheroine is instructed in recognising fish and gutting them . The story however carries little conviction .
-1

There 's little ingenuity , and from a technical standpoint alone this might as well have been made for television for all the imagination that 's sadly on display .

Instead of delivering the equivalent of an Airplane !, Jerry Zucker has made a monstrosity more akin to a plane crash .

This Earth could have moved if they had embraced the heart of Starman . Too bad they settled for a half-hearted Independence Day .

Just about everything in this pea-brained epic is overscaled and overwrought -- it 's a cartoon trying to be a towering triptych . The dissonance between the film 's heroic ambitions and its grindingly coarse treatment is rather amusing .

Breezy , harmless and mildly engaging , but ultimately insipid and forgettable .

Frustratingly immature , more a shadow than a reflection of its forbears , sincere but naive in its intentions , ultimately unwilling to take the risks that might distinguish it on its own merits .

Given that its wings have been severely clipped since it finished lensing two years ago , View From the Top flubs nearly every opportunity to be the comedy it wanted to be .

We could use an upbeat film with a solid Frank Capra vibe . But New in Town doesn't elicit a rah-rah spirit so much as it reawakens the cynical thought that such lazy screenwriters deserve to be out of work .

The result is like watching an over-extended sketch . The first few minutes make you laugh . The next bring a slight smile . The rest of the time you are silent , the joke and the accompanying freshness having long gone stale .

Eastwood on top of his game wouldn't have made a movie so easy to figure out or so painful to watch .

Slow and stately , Pascali 's Island never gets beneath its own superficial gentility .

Because the film is so glossy , so flippant in its presentation of the world that author J.K. Rowling has spent her sizable novels dissecting , that I still don't have a good idea what all the fuss is about .

Oozing opulence from every pore , this big budget motion picture is more melodramatic history lesson than epic extravaganza .

This ' Why bother ?' spinoff of the ' 70s undercover cop show is little more than a 99-minute shtickfest built around something resembling a plot .

Until it crosses a shadowy line dividing serious comedy from distasteful exploitation , The Babysitters has the makings of an incisive satire of greed and lust in suburbia .

Chris Morgan ( the screenwriter on " The Fast and the Furious : Tokyo Drift " - 2006 ) is to blame for a script that runs more like a ' 70s Ford Pinto than the hopped up muscle cars burning rubber onscreen .

It 's a claustrophobic dud , full of ludicrously purple tough-guy dialogue and lip-smacking vamps in bikinis ( how hot ! ) , with so much monotonous hip violence there 's scarcely room for anything else .

If for some reason you are fascinated by the Wonderland murders , look up the Rolling Stone article of 1989 that brought national attention to the gruesome case . Otherwise , your local cineplex has lots of choices with more redeeming social value .

Jacknife is not a bad film -- it simply fails to say anything new about the post-Vietnam experience .

Big Fish makes a big push for transcendence , but the strain shows . It 's like trying to push a daydream uphill .

The eerie buildup is mostly pro forma ... But the backstory of the haunted house , revealed slowly in sepia-toned hallucinations , really is creepy .

You can see where you're supposed to laugh and cry , but most of the time the techniques employed to achieve this err too far on the side of subtlety . Because of this , Second Hand Wedding doesn't linger long in the memory after the credits have rolled
-1

Strangely dull .
-1

Stylish to a fault , this graphic novel adaptation is never as good as its opening credit sequence .
-1

Has the same effect as an encounter with a phony physic-it keeps delivering just enough to tantalize , never has a real payoff and eventually makes you realize that you've been conned .

The actual fights between the predators and the serpents are too silly to contemplate . Both shiny and metallic , they look like kitchen appliances fighting it out .

From the look of it , poor Debra Messing 's first starring vehicle was an unmitigated disaster even before the cameras started rolling .

A clumsily supernatural mystery that strangely uses the fallible density of flesh as its most underscored symbol .

While it is not uncommon for Serious Actors to lighten up and make a film their kids can see , it is nonetheless jarring to see someone on the level of Don Cheadle turn up in a January-released , kiddie animal programmer .

Robert Pattinson proves he can do more than fanged heartthrob , but while the film should sate his legion fans til their next Twilight fix , there 's not a lot here for the rest of us .

Burt Reynolds used to make movies about people 's lifestyles . Now he seems more interested in making movies that fit in with his own lifestyle .

The movie plunges straight down that treacherous black hole that exists between fact and fiction and the inability to replicate either .

Fantastic Four is a trailer trash cousin of Batman and Spider Man .

There is little in life sadder to see than a film that thinks it has a great deal to say of a revelatory or profound nature , but doesn't

The Polar Express seems overly concerned with aping real life instead of creating its own universe .

Unlikely to inspire rioting at the box office , unless it 's by people demanding their money back .

If anyone involved in this sloppy , inexplicable slasher flick had a notion of what they were doing or why , they've kept it to themselves .

Hollywoodland certainly deserves some Oscar buzz , but the overall failures of the film will ultimately outweigh the genius of Affleck 's performance .

Clumsily mounted , implausibly plotted , often wincingly bad attempt at an Aussie genre piece ... makes the same fundamental mistake as last year 's Blame : small-scale thrillers need stories that are duck-bum tight .

Takes a volatile story and jams it into the framework of a Hollywood template .
-1

Elegant but cold and meandering homage to film noir .
-1

Mediocre direction and a screenplay that catches the tail-end of an intriguing subject yet doesn't suitably develop it .
-1

This is not a date film , nor is it a chick flick . I'm not sure who it 's for , but it 's probably not you .

When the score ( from the original ) is the best part of this retelling , perhaps it 's best we don't celebrate Halloween this year .
-1

About as entertaining as watching paint dry .

Shamelessly manipulative , as the humorless , heavy-handed script only superficially skims the dramatic surface of this true story of devotion and sacrific .

A Mike Leigh mistake .

It 's all a little disappointing , particularly given the talents involved .

The movie does show some welcome wit as it satirizes the idiocies of morning TV -- until it starts repeating itself in the second half .

But aside from the historical value ... there 's not a lot here to keep one 's attention
-1

Whether based on fact or not , now is not the time for yet another feel good sports movie about a small town coach who battles against local public perception to take his team of misfits to the championships .
-1

Good-natured enough to entertain here and there , but that otherwise loses its way long before the characters complete their implausible quest .
-1

The film 's cynicism , like everything else , is nothing more than empty posturing , a fashionable pose adopted to ingratiate itself with a disenfranchised public .
-1

It 's a reasonably promising debut , though , and Sir Ben looks as though he had a lot of fun , not least when he 's deflowering Mary-Kate Olsen , surprisingly funny as the planet 's last remaining hippy .

An absurd and unconvincing fright pic .

The storyline is highly suspect .

With over eight months left in the year , it requires a certain audacity to declare that The Life Before Her Eyes is , and will always be , the absolute worst film of 2008 ...

If you are now or ever have been a girl of 8 to 13 , you'll be occasionally charmed by the giggly bonds of girlfriends and ' guppie love ' the film portrays -- but also occasionally green at the gills .

At least from this audience member 's vantage point , this is not a Night to remember , but to avoid .

In truth , there is little wrong with this film that would not have been excusable if it were the first version in two decades rather than six months . PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is competently made .

Smart casting and stand-out performances don't compensate for the twee source play and an over-ambitious screenplay from Branagh .

The animation is so stiff it makes South Park look like Walt Disney 's Fantasia .

An uncertain , but also unboring , neo-noir comedy that has more than its share of gimmicks .

One of Kazan 's most autobiographical films , America , America , drawing on the immigration experience of his uncle , was nominated for Best Picture Oscar , but is one of the few flops in his distinguished career .

The ship is ugly , the ghosts are boring , and the effects ( with the possible exception of the cheese-cutter incident ) are less than spectacular .
-1

Despite a few chuckles , this loud , obvious and raunchy comedy suffers from a worse fate than its cheesiness - it 's utterly forgettable .
-1

It 's a movie that spoofs intelligence in the most unintelligent way possible and stretches the boundaries of plot-free filmmaking into frontiers until now explored only by former cast members of Saturday Night Live .

We're not sure why one is supposed to care .

Unfortunately , " Blood and Honey " has script problems : Its core story is less compelling than its overall atmosphere .

" When there're no more original ideas in Hollywood , the studios will opt to remake ." And , in first-time director Zack Snyder 's case , poorly .

Michael Bay is credited as producer , but he might as well be the director of this impersonal hybrid of a movie , a combo of genres and formats , which bears his technical signature , especially in the big , noisy , overproduced action set-pieces .

Lacks distinctiveness that would lift it above middle-of-the-road domestic drama .

All of it is preposterous , stretching plausibility until it breaks , with final-act explanations -- such as why someone as low-rent as Buddy Israel would be welcomed into the mob in the first place -- only leading to more absurdity .

' Despite its sitcom style trappings , there is some potential in the basic premise of this farce . Perhaps with a better and/or at least different script , direction and cast , it might have been a decent and maybe even funny comedy . Alas , the world will neve

From beginning to end , everything that happens in " The Descendants " feels false .

While one would not expect a film to include the sort of psychological and political analysis of Dostoyevsky 's The Possessed , its total absence leaves the viewer with an inability to understand their motivations .

When a cameo by Matthew Broderick is just a set-up to name his character " Buellerton " it 's time to ring in the New Year and call it a night .

The film is well done . But it is a late arrival in a decade-long parade of dysfunctional-family indie films .

" American Reunion " relies on clichés about nostalgia , forced tension over strained friendships and melodrama about the rekindling of first loves .

My most not favorite Saw film . I don't know that I'll watch it again but I'll at least keep the ending in mind as I rewatch my more favorite Saw films and show them to my kids .

An unwatchable mess like this is exactly what you ought to expect from anybody with the unmitigated gall to overhaul Neil Simon .

It is as if the director had studied the comedies of Eric Rohmer and Woody Allen from top to bottom and come away with all the wrong lessons .

And what crop is Dylan growing , you ask ? Sunflowers . Yes , sunflowers . Agriculture 's baby-step from farming dandelions . Why not just harvest weeds ?

I like Tyler Perry 's movies best when the character of Medea isn't in them .

Bernstein 's music , Sondheim 's lyrics and Robbins 's choreography are great , but as a movie it falls short of the truly inspired cinematic musicals .

I expected to laugh a lot harder and more frequently . Mama 's Boy isn't what I'd call a terrible movie . Instead , it 's a movie that assembles a lot of interesting elements that never gel .

The urgency and intensity help offset the familiarity of the material .

Drab and unfeeling .

Even for sugary neon fluff , it 's awfully lightweight .

The movie 's desire to be devastating and richly ironic are as sloppy and embarrassing as the metaphorical wolf donning a sheep 's wool to effect a disguise .

A romantic comedy about bright , funny , confused young people in San Francisco , it fails to be bright or funny itself , only confused .

Quite apart from the fact that it 's spectacularly uninventive and uncontroversial , it 's just such a luvvie-fest .

Becomes an excruciating exercise in gothic excess and progressively more disgusting imagery .

Attack of the Clones emerges looking as bad as if not worse than its 1999 predecessor , thanks to the lame romantic subplot , which is so badly written , directed and performed that it surpasses Jar-Jar Binks as the all-time low point in the series .

The moviemakers left the story line open for a sequel , but in this case , let 's hope once is enough .

U . K . -set monster movie has few scares , plenty of noxious overtones .

The whole movie is so generic feeling and such a blatant waste of precious smart-comedy resources , I can't advise anyone to see it . I gave it Network with Snacks because Jason Bateman needs a vehicle for his brilliance wherever he can get one .

A dull retread . ... Not even the film 's easily enchanted target audience -- that is , children -- are likely to stay under the spell for long .

The films always look good and have well-staged action , but they don't have one iota of originality or imagination -- to the extent of virtually recreating key scenes from The Matrix , Die Hard and The Descent .

A diversionary end-of-summer time-killer .

Another Jackie Chan " search for the great whatsit " action film that 's as agreeable as it is disposable .

A piece of blandly enthusiastic , B-movie pulp .

It seems Weide and Pegg were determined to make good on their title How to Lose Friends& Alienate People . You can sum up their results in two words : mission accomplished .

Even lesser hacks than McG would have trouble making Jamie Linden 's screenplay float , but I never thought it was possible to blow every big inspirational moment . Maybe because they are all the same .

Dwayne ( The Rock ) Johnson has a pleasant onscreen presence , but with material as flimsy and humourless as this , he looks ridiculous wearing a pink tutu , tights and oversize wings , sneaking into homes to collect teeth from sleeping children .

It is a comedy that almost feels as if it needed to spend a little more time in the oven cooking , and at the end of the day the only additive I could smell coming off of it was the faint aroma of half-baked disappointment .

All of the nastiness here gets a little tiresome after awhile , as do the attempts to glamorize the drug trade .

Mike Binder 's oddball film keeps retreating into fantasy -- as if to avoid precisely the kind of issues that have kept the studios from confronting the legacy of 9/11 .

This sense of temporal suspension , enhanced by a slight fuzziness to the cinematography , is the fim 's most endearing quality . Otherwise it 's nothing more than a soggy tale of redemption in the face of mortality .

Writer Director James Gunn ( " Slither " ) beats the dead dog of fanboy culture with an idiotic movie that follows in the faux transgressive footsteps of " Kick-Ass ."

The 2009 version , perhaps like New York itself , is flashier and far less gritty . The camerawork is busier , the effects are expensive , the colours louder . The soundtrack , a bastard mix of rocky techno and crude drum ' n ' bass , recalls a car ad from 1996 .

At least the kills are plentiful and the splatters are fairly generous . That bare minimum of attention will always earn a little respect from me and my fellow GoreHounds .

Seeing as how this is essentially a teen comedy about guys in their early 30s , some of the laughs are kind of creepy and uncomfortable , but the directors have tons of genuine affection for the characters .

Despite excellent performances , this sordid story of the rise and decline of a modestly talented actor elicits little sympathy . It 's a tawdry , turgid saga of self-destruction that leaves an aftertaste of profound sadness .

What kind of kid will be able to appreciate this serious plot , which involves investors pulling out of a land-development deal and a scary , knife-wielding witch ?

One doesn't expect a movie of this type to be plausible , but this one stretches the plausibility factor past the snapping point to the unintentional-laughter point .

The television ad spots and theatrical trailers for The Guardian apparently tell most , if not all , of the film 's story in just a minute or two .

Reitman , comedy maestro of 1970s and 1980s , has clearly lost his touch , for this picture is even less funny and even more out of synch with the comedy genre , Hollywood , and the zeitgeist than his previous effort , Evolution .

Loaded with laughs but short on action , this big-budget sequel feels less like a comic book flick and more like a superhero version of ' Arthur .'

Though you can empathize with Gianni 's loneliness , the lecherous buffoon is too much of a stock type to feel fresh . At times , the comedy is shamelessly broad .

If you are a Kevin James fan you probably will want to see him rolling around , otherwise you can pass on this one to save a few bucks .

The story hasn't changed much , nor have the characters . But the comedy is now crude instead of whimsical and its characters overblown caricatures instead of screwball personalities . A movie has been reduced to a sketch .

Josef Goebbels had a home movie made of the failed 1944 Hitler assassins being hanged from meathooks with piano wire . It probably had more laughs , more fun , more feelgood moments than this family comedy .

The film stays mostly on the rather safe and familiar surfaces of LGBT history as it attempts to highlight a perhaps not-so-well-known facet of drag-ball culture .

Bukowski would be better served by a critical examination of his life , one which gets past the sentimental façade of an artist who played the roué to keep from tasting the bitterness ( as Stephen Crane once put it ) of his own heart .
